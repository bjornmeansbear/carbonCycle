# Carbon Cycle Notes

One of the most important elements on earth

One of the most abundant elements period

All earth life is based on carbon

carbon is contained and moved from one state and place to other states/places -- this is the carbon cycle

human activities are releasing all these different stores of carbon (forests, plants, soil, fossil fuels) into airbone CO2

Atmosphere is a small carbon sink, roughly 1% of the earths carbon pool. But, since its not that much, we can easily change it by disrupting other aspects of the carbon cycle (like releasing a bunch from below ground via burning fossil fuels or crappy land managment practice)

Disturbing the other stores/systems releases more to the atmosphere and that rapidly has a drastic, immediate, & lasting affect (effect?)

drop of food coloring in a cup of water versus a pool of water... as illustration?

plants/trees take their carbon from the atmosphere. photosynthesis

the main issue is that we keep adding more to the atmosphere without taking some out -- plants use what we normally respirate; but if we're unearthing carbon from ground and below ground stores its too much too fast.

Carbon is in everything on earth (pretty much)

Carbon eneters the atmosphere as CO2 from respiration and combustion (decomposition is also a form of respiration)

Photosynthetic plants take CO2 from the air and use that C to grow, release the O2 back to the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis builds carbohydrates for plants to use for their life processes. Mostly in the form of Glucose. How that works, well, that's another presentation for a different class... or for your own research... 

There is a sub cycle, less CO2 in northern hemisphere summers, more in winters due to northern boreal forests growing and then losing foliage for the winter...

1. carbon enters the atmospher as CO2 through respiration and combustion.
2. carbon is absorbed as CO2 by plants through photosynthesis; used to make glucose (C + H20 = carbohydrates)
3. Animals + other organisms eat plants moving some of that carbon into their bodies (moves along the foodchain). We mainly then exhale out the carbon we've taken in from eating as CO2 -- Aerobic respiration.
4. Animals, insects, microbes, and plants all eventually die. Decomposition breaks down the dead matter returning more C to the atmosphere as CO2 (microbe respiration also releases CO2). However, somtimes decomposition is blocked and the plant or animal matter gets buried -- this sequesters this carbon, containing it underground or underwater. This might eventually turn into sedimentary rock or into fossil fuels. 
5. When/If we unearth fossil fuels and burn them, combustion causes that carbon to become CO2 in the atmosphere.

Fast and slow processes 

Fast are all the regular life processes -- these turn carbon from one form to another in minutes, days, weeks, or years... (respiration, decomposition, combustion)

Slow are the geological processes. like the forming of rocks and fossil fuels. These take decades, centuries or millenia.
