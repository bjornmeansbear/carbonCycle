# The Carbon Cycle.

## What is Carbon?

Carbon is the 4th most abundant element in the Universe (behind Hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon)

Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust

Carbon is a cool element -- its capable of 4 bonds, more than most other things, so its able to organize in a lot of different ways and make a lot of different kinds of structures. Diamonds. Sugars. Graphite. Rocks. Proteins. Coal. Biochar. the list goes on.

Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date -- and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements"

## Why is Carbon Important?

Carbon is the foundational element of life on earth. Every living thing -- and many inanimate things -- are based on carbon chains. Plants are carbon based, microbes are carbon based. we're carbon based.

Carbon anchors all organic substances, it is a polymer, it binds things together, forms chains, helps things get organized, is basis for all life

Carbon plus hydrogen and oxygen make hydrocarbons (and carbohydrates), equals fossil fuels equals crude oil, gasoline,kerosene

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, celluloses, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids and proteins. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical codes of life.

Makes hardest materials and softest materials, diamond and graphite for example ...

It is found in all living things, also in the atmosphere and  in limestone layers in ocean also in all fossil fuels (coal,oil)

Whew!

## What does Carbon Do?

## How does it Move around?
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else.

This is the carbon cycle...
