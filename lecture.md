## What is Carbon?

Carbon is the 4th most abundant element in the Universe (behind Hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon)

Carbon is the 15th most abundant element in the Earth's crust

Carbon is cooler than other elements!! -- its capable of 4 bonds, so its able to organize in a lot of different ways and make a lot of different kinds of structures. Diamonds. Sugars. Graphite. Rocks. Proteins. Coal. Biochar. the list goes on.

Carbon forms a vast number of compounds, more than any other element, with almost ten million compounds described to date -- and yet that number is but a fraction of the number of theoretically possible compounds under standard conditions. For this reason, carbon has often been referred to as the "king of the elements"

## Why is Carbon Important?

Carbon is the foundational element of life on earth. Every living thing -- and many inanimate things -- are based on carbon chains. Plants are carbon based, microbes are carbon based. we're carbon based.

Carbon anchors all organic substances, it is a polymer, it binds things together, forms chains, helps things get organized, is basis for all life

Carbon plus hydrogen and oxygen make hydrocarbons (and carbohydrates), equals fossil fuels equals crude oil, gasoline,kerosene

When combined with oxygen and hydrogen, carbon can form many groups of important biological compounds including sugars, celluloses, lignans, chitins, alcohols, fats, and aromatic esters. With nitrogen it forms alkaloids, and with the addition of sulfur also it forms antibiotics, amino acids and proteins. With the addition of phosphorus to these other elements, it forms DNA and RNA, the chemical codes of life.

Makes hardest materials and softest materials, diamond and graphite for example ...

It is found in all living things, also in the atmosphere and in limestone layers in ocean also in all fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas, etc. -- any "Hydro _carbon_" and any "_Carbo_ Hydrate") ...

Whew!

## What CO2?

Carbon plus oxygen make carbon dioxide, CO2 is essential for biological life -- plants "breathe" in CO2... more on this...

## CO2 in the atmosphere.

CO2 is a gas. Our atmosphere is the envelope around our planet where energy from the sun is temporarily stored, giving us the temperatures necessary for life. Co2 along with methane and water vapor are termed greenhouse gases as they are semi opaque gases that allow for the suns energy in the form of visible light to enter the atmosphere but partially block it after it bounces off the earth’s surface in the form of heat. The balance of what is allowed into the atmosphere and  the amount that is allowed back out is what determines the atmospheres temperature. In particular the Lower Atmosphere where we live. The higher concentration of greenhouse gases, the more heat confined to the atmosphere.

## How does it Move around?
Under terrestrial conditions, conversion of one element to another is very rare. Therefore, the amount of carbon on Earth is constant (effectively -- the stray meteorite might bring some new stuff in; and we send some up into near space via our space/satellite missions). Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it from somewhere and dispose of it somewhere else.

This is the carbon cycle...

## What is the “Carbon cycle”?

With our current understanding of the earth’s dynamics the carbon cycle is the way that we observe carbon cycling through the planets interconnected systems. 

The total cycle has within it two systems that operate at different time scales, these are the Geological and the Biological. The Geological is slow and steady and relies on entire ecosystems...

## Geological Carbon Cycle: thousands; tens of thousands; millions of years

Carbon was present at the forming of Earth, (bombarding meteorites, random space debris coming together, etc.)  H2O and CO2 in the atmosphere form to make a weak acid (—carbonic acid) that upon raining down releases the calcium (amongst other things) from exposed rock and washes it into the ocean where it settles onto the seabed. (confirm this?) 

Rivers carry calcium ions—the result of chemical weathering of rocks—into the ocean, where they react with carbonate dissolved in the water. The product of that reaction, calcium carbonate, is then deposited onto the ocean floor, where it becomes limestone. (NASA earth observatory)

Calcium carbonate from crustacean shells, corals, etc. also gets washed down to the deep ocean and participates in the same process.

With the movement of the earth’s crust it is then drawn back into the earth’s mantle through subduction, where it becomes magma, through volcanic eruptions is released again as CO2, volcanic gas and lava. 

This system regulates amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide which in turn contributes to the regulation of the earth’s temperature. (Meaning it adds large quantities of CO2 to atmosphere on occasion; making up for excess carbon that would be being stored by living plants; sans human intervention) 

Over the course of the earth’s history this cycle has varied in intensity, this variable is thought to be a contributing factor in the oscillation of ice ages and periods of warming or deglaciation.

## Biological: days, weeks, months, years, centuries, thousands of years...

The biological cycle is based on these two main :
- Carbon enters the atmosphere as CO2 from respiration and combustion (decomposition is also a form of respiration)
- Photosynthetic plants take CO2 from the air and use that C to grow, and then release the O2 back to the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis is the foundation of the biological carbon cycle system, through photosynthesis plants combine solar energy and CO2 into sugars or carbo hydrates, this is the energy of cell division… basically, growth...

Photosynthetic plants take CO2 from the air and use that C to grow, release the O2 back to the atmosphere.

Photosynthesis builds carbohydrates for plants to use for their life processes. Mostly in the form of Glucose. How that works, well, that's another presentation for a different class...  or for your own research... but its the coolest kind of solar energy...

CO2 is used and temporarily sequestered in the biological cycle by being stored in living and dead plant matter, roots, in the soil, eaten by animals (us)

In the oceans CO2 is stored in phytoplankton, clamshells these settle to bottom and form limestone, sediments,fossil fuels this is one place where the biological and the geological carbon cycles interconnect.

Photosynthesis and respiration provide both a daily and annual fluctuation in CO2 levels (chart of winters in Northern Hemisphere?)

There is a sub cycle, less CO2 in northern hemisphere summers, more in winters due to northern boreal forests growing and then losing foliage for the winter...

1. carbon enters the atmospher as CO2 through respiration and combustion.
2. carbon is absorbed as CO2 by plants through photosynthesis; used to make glucose (C + H20 = carbohydrates)
3. Animals + other organisms eat plants moving some of that carbon into their bodies (moves along the foodchain). We mainly then exhale out the carbon we've taken in from eating as CO2 -- Aerobic respiration.
4. Animals, insects, microbes, and plants all eventually die. Decomposition breaks down the dead matter returning more C to the atmosphere as CO2 (microbe respiration also releases CO2). However, somtimes decomposition is blocked and the plant or animal matter gets buried -- this sequesters this carbon, containing it underground or underwater. This might eventually turn into sedimentary rock or into fossil fuels. 
5. When/If we unearth fossil fuels and burn them, combustion causes that carbon to become CO2 in the atmosphere.

## The Natural CO2 Regulators...

We can look at both the biological and geological as a vast unified carbon regulator, a system the absorbs and releases carbon at different rates over different periods of time.

Normally this is a closed self regulating system with minor slow fluctuations that historically we can see records of in ice layers, etc. It has contributed to some weather changes in the psat (we can now match CO2 measurements in ice cores to historical documentation we have from other places... mini ice age in europe as example?)

## Carbon Sinks

all things store carbon for differing lengths, even our bodies are a type of temporary CO2 containers... 

carbon is contained and moved from one state and place to other states/places -- this is the carbon cycle -- and those containers for storing especially large amounts of carbon are called carbon sinks. 

Most of Earth’s carbon—about 65,500 billion metric tons—is stored in rocks. The rest is in the ocean, atmosphere, plants, soil, and fossil fuels.(from NASA earth observatory link)

The prairie is a carbon sink; wetlands and marshes are carbon sinks; forests can be; the oceans; corral reefs ... we can also create new ways; burning wood into bio char; make cement that acts like calcium carbonate to absorb more CO2 overtime; etc...

The Atmosphere is actually a relatively small carbon sink, roughly 1% of the earths carbon pool. But, since its not that much, we can easily change it by disrupting other aspects of the carbon cycle; distrubing these other carbon sinks (like releasing a bunch from below ground via burning fossil fuels or crappy land managment practice)

Disturbing the other stores/systems releases more to the atmosphere and that rapidly has a drastic, immediate, & lasting affect (effect?)

drop of food coloring in a cup of water versus a pool of water... as illustration?

## Fossil Fuels (A special kind of carbon sink!?)
Fossil fuels are also a kind of carbon sink. Biological system carbon in the form of plant and animal matter might end up not decomposing... if its covered or trapped it doesn't decompose... it then ends up becoming trapped... that carbon doesn't respirate back into the atmosphere; it is stored underground. Overtime, the plant or animal matter becomes fossil fuels!

## Human Activity

Human activities are releasing all these different stores of carbon (forests, plants, soil, fossil fuels) into airbone CO2

The main issue is that we keep adding more to the atmosphere without taking some out -- plants use what we normally respirate; but if we're unearthing carbon from ground and below ground stores its too much too fast.

## Fossil Fuel Usage

## Farming Practice

## Deforestation

I'll repeat again: The main issue is that we keep adding more to the atmosphere without taking some out -- we've short circuited the normal cycle -- plants use what we normally respirate; but if we're unearthing carbon from ground and below ground stores its too much too fast.

Okay, so is this a good lecture? does this exist? why isn't it showing up on github or other computers! what!!!!
